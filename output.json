      "Getting to know the Experience Manager": "Chargebee Retention redirects canceling or downgrading customers through Retention Experiences to view Loss Aversion Cards, gather insights from the Exit Survey, deflect cancels with Offers. It all starts in the Retention Experience Manager.",
      "Chargebee Retention Category & Reasons": "We have found that there are three subscription business models that typically use Chargebee Retention - SaaS, Digital, and eCommerce. These business models each have their own unique set of customer challenges, and thus warrant having different Survey Reason Libraries to support them. Therefore, we break our default Chargebee Retention Survey Reasons down into Business Models and Categories within those business models. The benefit of mapping your cancelation reasons to the corresponding Chargebee Retention Business Model and Survey Reason is that this allows us to properly categorize that reason for our benchmarking. We currently provide Chargebee Retention Benchmarks offline via your dedicated TAM, but will be introducing these into the admin app in the future. We realize that not all possible categories are available here so choose the one that best fits your survey question. It won't affect what your canceller sees in the Experience. When you go to create a new survey reason in Chargebee Retention, you will first choose which Business Model you want to select a reason from: Here is a breakdown of the Business Models and Categories within each: Then within each Category, we have a subset of Chargebee Retention Reasons that we have standardized from working with other Customers. Try to find the Chargebee Retention Reason that maps best to your specific cancel reason. This step is important because it will allow us to connect that reason to our cross company benchmarking later. For example, how do you compare to the industry average at deflecting customers who select reasons related to shipping delays for example, or poor customer onboarding experiences? Taking some time upfront to get this right is worth the effort. If you have already created a reason and don't think it has the correct category, fear not, you can change it within the Reason Library. If you signed up for Chargebee Retention prior to Nov, 2021 you initially launched under our old reason library, which was mostly aimed at the SaaS use case. You will notice that your reasons either now are classified as SaaS or Legacy. If they are Legacy, that means that you may need to go in and re-map this reason to one of our new Chargebee Retention Reasons to pick up the benefit of our expanded Business Model and Category benchmarking. If you have any questions about this, please contact your TAM or retention-support@chargebee.com and we will assist you.",
      "Edit your Cancel Page Template": "To create a new page in your Chargebee Retention Admin App, navigate to the Experience Manager and select the Pages tab. Here you have the option to Copy a page. Once a page has been copied it will be available to be added to the Targeting Tab and incorporated into a split test in Chargebee Retention . If you are looking for best practice tips on the look and feel of your page, visit our page style guide .",
      "Retention Workflow Session Fees": "Chargebee Retention has a hybrid \"usage-based\" pricing model. We sell base plans across three different packages, Essentials, Performance, and Enterprise. Each plan comes with an allotment of Retention Workflow Sessions per month. Chargebee Retention's Retention Workflow Sessions represent an opportunity to save your customers and extend their LTV over time. Therefore, these sessions are incredibly valuable and the value of Chargebee Retention scales as your number of sessions and Saves increase. We thus base our pricing on these Session limits. Our plans can be either billed monthly/quarterly or annually for a discount. Regardless of the subscription term, your session limit will be calculated on a rolling 30-day window based on when you signed up for your initial plan. Your base plan will include x sessions per month at $ per session. Each session you use up to the limit is included in the Subscription price. If you go over your limit, you will be charged the per-session rate for each of your Extended Sessions during that period. You can track your current session utilization in the Account > Plan tab in Settings. Session limits will not carry over from month to month. Chargebee Retention will not count duplicate sessions in the same billing period. We cohort sessions based on their start date for the purposes of Extended Session tracking. This means that if a user is deflected during this 30 day billing period, and then cancels in the next 30 day billing period, you will only be charged for the single session during this period. The subsequent session will not count towards your monthly limit. If you are over your Retention workflow session limit for the month, you can upgrade to lock in a lower rate for each of your subsequent sessions during that period. In the example above, we have used 75/50 included sesssions. 50 of these sessions were \"free\" or included in your subscription, and the additional 25 you have accrued will be billed at $5.00 per session for an additional $125. If you upgrade during the middle of a plan, we will apply the upgrade immediately and bill you for each session used over your existing limit at your current rate, in this case the $125. We will then set your new rate and carry over the included sessions from your previous plan, in this case 50 because these were not charged for in the overage fee. Your base plan will be credited for the unused time, and the new plan will be prorated for the remaining period. If you have any questions about your current session limit or how your Retention Workflow Sessoins are tracked, please contact retention-support@chargebee.com .",
      "Creating Offers with Retention AI": "Chargebee Retention helps merchants reduce churn by presenting the right offer to the right customer at the right time.  However, crafting the right offer can be a time consuming process and merchants may not know the right offer content to maximize offer performance. With Retention AI, creating an offer is now easier than ever.  Generate and test high performing offer content in under a minute.  This feature is available to all Chargebee Retention customers, except for customers using the multi-brand feature.  Support for multi-brand customers will be coming soon. To get started with creating offers with AI, click the \"New offer with Retention AI\" button. Verify the company details you provided when setting up your Chargebee Retention account.  Please ensure this information is accurate.  This information will be used by the AI model to generate relevant offer copy and for reporting such as the industry benchmark dashboard report. Enter a description for the target audience for your offer.  While this is an optional step, we recommend you provide a detailed description of your customer segment to tailor your offer copy.  Example:  \"Customers on the annual Standard plan.\"  See the Best practices for copy generation for more details and examples for the audience field. Next, select your offer category.  Retention AI can generate offer copy for discount, pause, extension, plan change, and multi-action (plan change + discount) offers. Click \"Generate results\" to review the recommended offer copy.  We will send information about your company, target customer, and offer to a Large Language Model (LLM).  Please expect a short processing period for the LLM to generate offer copy based on the details provided. We will display 3 recommendations generated by AI.  Select any of the recommendations to preview the offer copy on the right side of the screen. Click \"Generate more\" to view more offer copy recommendations from AI.  You can view the last 9 results generated from AI.  Select Offer Settings button when ready to review additional offer settings before deploying the offer. After generating offer copy, review options related to offer presentation, offer processing, customer experience after selecting the button, and placing the offer on a cancel page. Please refer to Editing an offer for more details on the above offer settings.  From the offer settings page, you can also re-enter the Retention AI flow to generate more offer copy recommendations.  Click \"Done\" to complete the offer setup. Looking to improve performance for existing offers?  Use Retention AI to optimize offer copy for existing offers.  Select an existing offer and click \"Generate with Retention AI\" to generate targeted offer copy with AI. The Retention AI experience allows you to supply additional details when generating offer copy.  This information will be used to tailor the offer copy to your customers.  Here are best practices to develop the most personalized offer copy. Help AI generate targeted offers by describing the target audience for the offer. You can use this section to provide more specific instructions when generating the offer copy and refining the results from AI.

      "Placing Offers and Loss Aversion Cards": "The key to driving a successful test in Chargebee Retention is finding the right mix of Offer and Loss Aversion Placement. The Experience Manager provides two main ways to place an Offer, via the Offer Library or via the Page Editor. The two placement tabs work slightly differently, so here is a quick overview of how to use them. When you are editing an Offer or Loss Aversion card in one of our Libraries, you have the option to click over to the Placement tab for that individual card. This view allows you to select the Reasons or Loss Aversion slots that you want to put that individual card into. In this view, you have the option to select different experiences and places that Offer into each one. Within an Experience, you are resented several locations where the Offer can be placed. Today we support two major Offer locations, in Loss Aversion Cards, and on Survey reasons. Each slot will be available to check, and if there is currently an offer in that location it will show to the right. Selecting a location that already has an Offer placed in it will remove the existing offer and replace it with the new one. Only Loss Aversion supported Offer Templates can be placed in the Loss Aversion card locations. If the Offer template you are editing is not supported in Loss Aversion locations, these will not be selectable and will be grayed out. By default we set all new customers to Page based offer. When page based offers are selected, that single offer will be activated for whichever reasons you select to enable it for. You also can toggle to Reason Based offers here. Offers that are eligible to be placed in Loss Aversion cards also can be added via the Page Editor. You can add an Entry offer that is presented immediately when the page loads. You can apply this Offer from within the Page Settings . Finally, Chargebee Retention supports a Final Step Offer that can be configured from the Final step modal tab within the page editor. We only support offers that contain a cancel URL in this offer placement so the user has an option to cancel directly from this modal. You can learn more about this type of offer in this article . To learn more about Offers, check out Understanding Offers .",
      "Preview your Page and Manage Branding": "Core to the Chargebee Retention Experience Manager editing experience is the ability to quickly preview your page and make edits to your branding. The Branding Page under the Experience tab allows you to do just this. This page serves as a preview of your Cancel Experience and allows you to edit the look and feel of your Chargebee Retention Page by selecting \"edit Branding\". You can edit the offers, reasons, and other elements of this page just like any other page, from the Pages tab in the Experience Manager. The Branding page also serves as the Default page that is copied when you create a new Test Page in Chargebee Retention. If you would like to switch the page that is selected as your Default page, please reach out to retention-support@chargebee.com and we will take care of this for you.",
      "Targeting Based on Offer History": "We have introduced additional audience properties to enable you to present different cancel pages and offers based on your customers' prior engagement with offers within the Chargebee Retention cancel page. For example, you can present a specific cancel page or offer if a customer accepted an offer or viewed but did not accept the offer. To set up targeting based on offer history, first define new audiences and then configure targeting using these new audiences. Within the Audience rules editor, we have added 4 new properties that can be used to target customers based on their prior engagement with offers in Chargebee Retention: Example: Define audience for customers who accepted 25% offer within the last 30 days After you have created the audiences based on offer views or accepts, you can set up targeting to present the desired experience for each audience. Here is a sample setup where a different cancel page and offer are presented for customers who accepted a 25% discount in the last 30 days or viewed but did not accept a 25% discount in the last 30 days. If you have any questions about this feature, please reach out to retention-support@chargebee.com .",
      "Testing with the Sample Session Generator": "The Sample Session Generator allows you to test the various components of your Chargebee Retention set up to ensure they are working properly for end users. This tool will generate a live Chargebee Retention session that will trigger all events/alerts and end-user actions associated with the Experience, but it will not be counted in reporting or against your session limit. You can access this tool from two locations: The form allows you to choose to test a specific page or the Targeting rules you have built out. If you select the Targeting rules, you will want to pick a test record that has the correct field values set on it to match the desired Targeting rule in Chargebee Retention. You also have the option to test the Live or Draft version of a page, which allows you to preview your changes before they go live to end-users to ensure everything is working properly. If you have an integrated Billing system with Enrichment enabled, then you will see the option to either look up a subscriber ID by email in that system or a field to input a subscriber ID into the test session. You will need a real subscription record for this test to work as we validate that record in your Billing system as part of the Enrichment call. We provide the option to test against either a Live or Test API key to give you the flexibility to test on either your prod Billing environment or your sandbox. The actions associated with this test session will be processed, which means that we will update the subscription record to reflect the cancel or offer accept that occurred. Be careful not to plug in a subscription ID that you do not actually want to test this functionality on. If you do not have Billing integrated, the form will look a little different. You will have the option to generate a random email + internal id or can input one yourself. There is no lookup to Billing here, so any random ID will work. If you have any questions about how to use this Sample Session Generator, please contact retention-support@chargebee.com .",
      "How to Process your Offers in Billing": "The Offer processing option determines how your Offer will be processed in your billing system. The direct Billing Integration is typically the easiest as it requires no custom development or manual workflows on your end. Webhooks and URL Redirects are viable options if you have development resources who can help assist with implementing them. Email can be a great option to get started if you don't have access to technical resources. Select the option that is best for you and then proceed into the Offer Editor to finish building out your Offer. For more on Editing an Offer visit this help doc . If you have any questions or need help setting up your Offer processing, please contact retention-support@chargebee.com .",
      "Drilldown Feedback Offer Layout": "The Drilldown offer layout allows you to capture additional information from users who select certain cancel reasons. With this Offer Layout and Action, you can create an additional single-choice question to ask customers when they select certain cancel reasons. Customers will use this Offer to try and gather additional feedback around things like product or service complaints. To do so, create a Customer Feedback Offer and then navigate to the Design Tab to select the Feedback Layout.  You can make this feedback offer a required step by hiding the \"x\" button to dismiss the offer modal. You also can add this modal as an additional modal after an Offer button via the Offer accept state tab in the Offer editor.  If you choose this option, we will present this Feedback modal after the user selects the offer button. You can find the results of these modals in the Customers Tab by adding the column Drilldown modal feedback. If you have any further questions about this feedback Offer or how to use it, please contact retention-support@chragebee.com .",
      "Avoiding Repeat Offer Accepts with Max Redemptions Settings": "One of the common questions we are asked about when customers are starting out their Offer Testing journey with Chargebee Retention is how we prevent users from \"abusing offers.\" The answer to this question lies in our Max Redemptions setting that can be enabled per offer. When enabled, this setting will limit the number of times a user can accept a certain Offer in Chargebee Retention. To configure this setting, open any Offer in Chargebee Retention and go to the \"Maximum Redemptions\" field. This field will default to \"Unlimited\" when a new offer is created. If you select a number between 1-5, we will update this Offer so that it can only be accepted by the user that many times. Once the limit has been exceeded, we will restrict the Offer from being accepted by the end user. In the case where a user returns to the cancel page after an initial session with the Offer Accept, we will either grey out this offer (if it is Loss Aversion Card) or we will restrict it from being presented all together (if it is a modal offer). If the user hits the back button immediately after taking this offer, we will restrict the Offer from being processed a second time. If you have any questions on how Max Redemptions work in Chargebee Retention, please contact retention-support@chargebee.com .",
      "Setting up Cancel Management at the Page Level": "In Chargebee Retention you have the option to configure Cancel Management at the Page or App level. When you have saved this setting, you then can go to the Settings Tab in the Page editor to configure how that individual page will have Cancelations applied. If you have any questions or need help setting up Manage Cancels per-page, please don't hesitate to reach out.",
      "Cancel & Offer Confirmation Page": "Chargebee Retention allows you to present your customers with a confirmation page when they complete a Retention session as a way to confirm that the user has canceled their subscription and/or accepted an offer. This page allows you to present a custom and branded message after a user clicks on a URL button destination that lets them know about the terms of their cancelation or offer and gives them an option to return to their account. You can manage this page in the Experience Manager under Libraries > Confirmation Pages. Here you can choose to set the Nevermind and Cancel button destination to either a Cancel confirmation URL, Global URL configuration, or a Confirmation page. When you select Confirmation page you get a list of the pages you have selected to choose from. This will route the button from this Experience to that Confirmation page. Note, if you are using URL redirects to process cancels, this page is not recommended because the cancel url will have to be moved to the confirmation page button, which could lead to user friction. This page works best if you are billing integrated customer or are processing cancels via webhook or email. If you have any questions about Cancel confirmation pages, please contact retention-support@chargebee.com .",
      "Multi-branded cancel experiences": "As a subscription business as you grow, you may have to launch multiple different brands to position each product uniquely within your subscribers. In order to ensure the best possible user experience for your online customers, you need to ensure brand & style consistency across different touch points your subscriber interacts with across their lifecycle. This is needed not just from user experience perspective, but also to ensure compliance with your organisation's branding guidelines. Maintaining a customised cancellation experience that works across your diversified subscriber base (differentiated by brands) can be a very challenging task. The complexity arises not just in implementing the cancellation experience itself but ensuring that you hyper-personalise the experience for each subscriber by giving them different offers, presenting them with different cancellation reasons and optimise the process further using data. That's where Chargebee Retention's new multi-branded cancellation experience feature comes into picture. This feature is purposely built to help enterprises with multiple different brands to provide a bespoke cancellation experience to their subscribers. Using this feature customers can not only set up their own style & branding specific to each brand but also configure pages, targeting, cancel reasons etc specific to each brand within the same retention application.  Below are the key benefits of this feature for the customers. Improved operational efficiency - Customers can now set up all their brands within the same retention application. This means less work and improved productivity through consolidation and reduction in the tools involved. Compliance with branding guidelines - Customers can stay compliant with their organization's branding guidelines and provide their customers a personalized cancellation experience unique to each brand. Consolidated insights for further optimisation - Since the brand setup is consolidated so is the generation and storage of data for all the brands. This makes the feedback process insightful and more efficient driving further optimisation and improvements. Please note that this feature is currently in Early Adopter Program (EAP) and can be enabled on request. You may drop an email to retention-support@chargebee.com to get this enabled for your retention application. Before you start to cancel experiences specific to a brand, you need to set up your brands within the retention application. This step is needed for the brand to be made available for referencing within the new pages, targeting, survey reasons etc that you plan to create specific to the brand. Begin by selecting the Create a new brand button on the top right section of the  Brand list screen. Enter the name and domain name for your brand as the first step and click on the Create Brand button. You will see that the brand is successfully created and the creation date and last modified dates are updated for the brand. The newly created brand will also be available in the brand list page. By default the brand is created in the INACTIVE status i.e. it will not start accepting traffic straightaway. However since the brand is now created, you may either choose to set up the brand specific cancel experiences, including pages, targeting and other artifacts or proceed with further setting up the brand as the next step. Once the brand is created, you may proceed towards setting up the branding for your brand. The process for setting up branding for a specific brand is very similar to setting up branding in a non multi-branded retention application. Please refer to the section to know more about how the branding can be set up. Once the branding is set up, you may proceed towards specifying the top of the funnel audience segment for this brand. The audience segment specified here is unique to the brand and is typically the first condition that will get executed to resolve the brand to which the subscriber belongs to. Based on the resolution of the brand, the subscriber is rendered the corresponding page for the brand. To specify branding rules, one can refer to the audience management section as the interface to specify the rules are very similar to how a typical audience segment gets created within the retention application. You may also choose to specify confirmation URLs for the brand to specify URLs to which the subscriber should be redirected to on clicking the Cancel or Never mind button. By default the brand is created with INACTIVE status i.e. not ready to accept the traffic. This is done to make sure customers are able to set up their cancel experience before the brand is activated to start receiving traffic. Once you are done setting up your cancellation experience you may come back to this page to activate the brand using the ACTIVE / INACTIVE Toggle. This toggle is available within the Brand Configuration section and also in the Brand list section against each brand name. Once you are done setting up you brands, you can start with setting up the brand specific cancellation experience for each brand. You will notice the newly created brand is now available in the brand drop down selector which is available within the retention application. You can use the brand selector drop down to switch context between different brands and manage your content more efficiently. You can set up cancellation pages specific to each brand. By default the pages created within a brand will inherit the branding of the selected brand. Pages created in one brand do not get shared with pages created within some other brand. The process to set up the cancellation page for multi-brand retention application is exactly the same as that for a non multi-branded retention application. Refer to the section for more details. In addition to specifying brand specific pages, you can also set up brand specific targeting rules specifically for each brand. The brand specific targeting rules, get executed post the audience segment rules configured at the brand level successfully resolves the brand. These targeting rules help to slot the subscriber within the right section of the cancellation funnel and show them the right cancellation experience. The targeting rules configured within one brand do not interfere or impact the targeting rules configured in the other brand. Please note that only the pages specific to the selected brand will be available for selection purposes within the targeting section, other pages will not be visible from the front end. To know how to setup targeting in retention, refer to the section . All artefacts created within the retention application are available for use across all the brands. Survey reasons, offers and LA cards once created can be shared across different brands. Offers and LA Cards in particular inherit the branding of the selected brand. However they can be placed across multiple different pages belonging to the same or multi brand. Using the available dashboards and reports you can analyze key trends and KPIs to measure the performance of each brand or multiple different brands. There are three ways in which data can be analyzed based on brands within retention. Brand level filters available within the dashboards, reports & Insights allows you to filter results by a specific brand. One can also aggregate the results for all the brands and measure the consolidated results across all brands. Brand drop down within Insights reports, helps to see a breakdown of key retention metrics by brands, audience, experience etc. One can nicely see and analyze how various brands fair relative to each other using this option. In addition to the insights reports, the brand level grouping is also available within the trends report as an option. This helps to view the breakdown of key retention metrics in a trend format across various brands. All settings configured within the retention application are shared across all the brands and are at application level. There have been no changes made in the functionality of these sections. Refer to section for more.",
      "Cancel Compliance Requirements": "Subscription businesses are facing increasing consumer protection regulations designed to reduce friction involved with subscription cancellations.  While these requirements differ across countries and/or states, they are generally focused on reducing the number of steps or time required to cancel subscriptions online. Chargebee Retention provides multiple options to customize and test cancel pages to reduce friction in the cancel experience to fulfill compliance requirements and retain customers.  With Chargebee Retention, you can set up a 1 click cancel experience after your customers land on the Chargebee Retention cancel page. To reduce the number of customer inputs and clicks to cancel, you can configure the cancel page to remove any of the questions or make them optional. Under Experiences > Pages, select the page to configure how these questions should be displayed. Click into each section header and select whether you want the question to be required, optional, or hidden from your customers. Example after clicking the pencil icon for Survey questions: The Chargebee Retention cancel page includes the ability to display a consent checkbox prior to clicking the cancel button and a confirmation modal after clicking the cancel button to finalize the cancel. You can disable the consent checkbox, the confirmation modal, or both. In addition to hiding questions on the cancel page, you can also choose to show or hide the Never mind buttons in the middle of the page or bottom of the page to optimize your cancel experience. You also have the ability to have the footer section containing the consent message, Cancel button, and Never Mind button to stay on the screen while you are scrolling to ensure customers can see their available options. To enable this, click on the footer section and enable the Sticky footer setting. This applies the sticky footer to all of your customers on desktop and mobile. You will be able to customize the display order of the cancel page sections for increased visibility. For each of these 4 sections, you can move them higher or lower on the page.  The logo image will always remain at the top of the page. Note, to enable sticky cancel and never mind buttons, section 4 will need to placed at the bottom of the page. To move a section, click the icon next to section and select \"Move up\" or \"Move down.\" Add offer, cancel, or nevermind buttons to any loss aversion card template. You can also add a combination of these buttons using the multi-CTA offer option. To create loss aversion card with buttons: To create a loss aversion card or modal offer with a Cancel or Never mind button: If you have any questions, please reach out to retention-support@chargebee.com .",
      "Using Emoji and Special Characters": "Chargebee Retention now allows you to add special characters such as emojis or other foreign characters to the Cancel Page. This allows you to support languages other than english, and embed emojis in your Page personalization and Offers. To add these special characters to your page, you will need to copy them from the emoji/special character keyboard. To do so, locate the keyboard on your machine, copy the desired emoji or special character and paste it into the Chargebee Retention Experience Manager. We currently support the following special characters:",
      "Understanding the Insights Report": "The Insights Report collects the Reason your customer Cancels or Downgrades from the Chargebee Retention Page, and aggregates the data into an easy-to-digest report you can break down in a number of ways. At a glance, view the number of visits to your Chargebee Retention Page alongside the number of Cancels, Saves, and Deflect Rate. A Reason on the Insights Report is the customer facing option for why they choose to cancel on the Chargebee Retention Page Reason Survey. Reasons are based on Chargebee Retention Categories, but customized for your business. The Category on the other hand, is the broader grouping for different Reasons on the Cancel Page Reason survey like Pricing, Company, Execution, Product, Customer Experience, Needs, and Shipping and Handling. For example, the Reasons \"Never got setup\" and \"Customer Service was Unsatisfactory\" both fall under the Category of Customer Experience, but speak to very different problems. Never got setup indicates a need for more focus on customer onboarding, where a poor customer experience might speak to more QA for customer support, but both problems are likely solved by the same team or department. Clicking into a specified Reason will pull up a drilldown list you can export.",
      "Getting to know Customer Pages": "The Customers Pages give you a comprehensive, easily exportable list of all your Customers that hit the Chargebee Retention Page grouped by outcome: All, Canceled, Saved, and those currently on the Active Watch list. Here's how we define how the lists are grouped together: Edit what information appears in the list by clicking the gear in the upper left corner.",
      "Retained Revenue Cohort Report": "The Retained Revenue Cohort report is enabled for Chargebee Billing and Recharge merchants who have Retained Revenue Impact reporting enabled. This report allows you to track how your sessions are driving down stream revenue, thus giving you a view into the revenue impact of your Deflection Funnel. This report charts out your total deflects by time period (can be toggled between weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly), and then tracks the repurchase performance of these cohorts over time. The date period for the report will filter by the session start date, and the chart contains three main components: your summary metrics, your cohort table, and your total metrics. We will break down each further: The first section of the Cohort report presents key Summary metrics to help you further understand each Cohort. Here we display the following: These metrics give you a quick snapshot into how your cohort is performing. Typically there will be a drop off between a deflect and a repurchase, which is represented in the First Time Repurchase Rate. For newer cohorts, this metric will start out low and increase as the cohort matures. Additionally, the First Time Repurchase Revenue allows you to see how much initial revenue a cohort generates. This can be an insightful number when compared with the total on the right hand column to see how much of your cohorts revenue is from repeat purchases vs. first time. Your cohort table metrics are the inside / colored cells in the table. These data points represent the total repurchase revenue that occurred in each subsequent period after the deflect. When looking at a monthly cohort and viewing the May cohort, Month 0 will be May, Month 1 will be June, Month 2 will be July, etc... This view allows you to track how your cohort drives down stream repurchases in each period after the initial deflection. The highest revenue periods will be shaded the darkest green, and the lowest white. This chart helps you track your customers repurchase behavior and identify patterns in performance over time. The final area in this report is the totals, which give you insight into the total amount of revenue generated in a given cohort or period after the session. The right hand Y axis totals sum the horizontal cohort rows across. So for May you will see the total revenue generated to date for the May cohort. This value will increase until 100% of the cohort has churned out. The X axis totals sum the vertical cohort rows. So Month 0 is the sum of all retained revenue in the same month as the deflection, Month 1 is the sum of all the first month after the deflections retained revenue. This allows you to see which months after the deflection generate the highest retained revenue. Typically Month 0 will not be the highest retained revenue month, as it takes some time for repurchases to occur. We typically see that Month 1 - Month 3 generate the highest retained revenue for a customer, but this can vary based on the billing frequency of your subscription model. Finally, the % of Deflects Still Paying represent the deflects that have not canceled / total deflects. This metric is static, meaning that at the end of a month we snapshot the state of the subscription, and determine what % of those deflects are still active in the billing system. This value is then averaged over all the cohorts to represent the average we typically see for Month 1, Month 2, Month 3 etc... This metric allows you to see how many customers are still active x number of periods after the initial session, which indicates the potential for your cohort to produce additional Retained Revenue. If you have any questions on the Retained Revenue cohort please contact retention-support@chargebee.com .",
      "Calculating lost and saved revenue": "Not every customer is created equally, and that's especially true in how each customer impacts your business. In order to truly know the impact a customer lost (or saved) has on your business, you need to look at the customers value in dollars and cents. By connecting to one of our supported billing integrations, currently with Chargebee, Stripe or Recurly, you'll be able to see revenue attributed to your Saves, Cancels, and Watch List customers. With the billing integrations connected and enabled, the Trends Report defaults to revenue totals instead of customer totals. Prefer to see the Customer view instead? Toggle \"View by customers\" to return to the original Trends Report. Drilling down into any cohort, the expanded customer list also displays revenue totals alongside the billing interval (monthly or annual), and the date the customer's subscription is set to expire. With billing integrated, the Insights report has an additional filter to View by Customers or View by Revenue. View by Revenue displays the % of Cancels by total Canceled Revenue instead of total Canceled Accounts. With billing integrations connected, Customer Pages have revenue, billing interval (monthly vs. annual) and Validation Status added to it.",
      "Reporting on Experience/Page Performance": "The Experience Performance report allows you to get a detailed breakdown of the performance of each of your Experiences (pages) in Chargebee Retention. This report allows you to view the various key Deflection Funnel metrics associated with each of your cancel pages to understand how various elements are performing. You can now answer the following questions: And many more... This is one of the most powerful reports in Chargebee Retention, so let's dig into the details. Here we give you the option to define up to three groupings, which will adjust the report accordingly. This gives you the flexibility to slice & dice your Experience Performance report as you see fit. A common selection is to display Audiences > Experiences. This gives you the option to slice and dice the report by either Audience, Experience or Reason and then break it down further for each of these groupings. You also can add additional columns to this report to see how each breakdown performs for metrics such as Offer Accept Rates and Passive Deflect Rates. If you have any questions about how to use the Experience Performance Report or the data you are seeing in it, please contact retention-support@chargebee.com .",
      "Reporting on Offer performance": "Get deeper insights into how your Chargebee Retention Experiences save customers with the Offer Performance report nested under Insights in the left sidebar. For each individual Offer or Offer category, see a breakdown: You can also opt to view the value by either Revenue or Customers, if you're using one of our billing integrations . The updated Offer Performance Report allows you to select how you would like to display the various groupings in the table. By default we will show a list of your Offer names when you first visit this report. Offer name is the specific Offer tested during the Chargebee Retention Experience. For example, if you have two different pause offers, one for two months and one for one month, you would want to name your offers accordingly so that your Offer Performance Report makes sense. You can rename offers in the Offer Library . We also give you the option to update the Groupings here by selecting the little funnel dropdown next to \"Offer name.\" Here we let you select up to three groups in your chart. You can choose from either the Audience, Experience, Offer Placement, Offer Category, Offer Name or CTA Text here. When you choose to add additional groups, they will be added into your report with the option to expand to see the sub-groups as well. This allows you to drill into your Offer Performance across a number of different levels. You can see how different Offers perform within an Audience or a specific Experience for example, or can evaluate how Offer Categories perform across your various Audiences at a high level. This added Grouping flexibility makes the Offer Performance report far more dynamic and easy to use to get the insights you need. For multi CTA offers, evaluate performance of each button on the offer by using the CTA Text grouping and adding the CTA Views column to the report. You can also adjust the groupings to view performance of the button across all offer placements. Remember that Offer categories presents the high-level overview of performance for broader types of Offers . We have six different Offer categories: You can select which metrics you would like to see in the Offer Performance Report by selecting \"Toggle column\" and updating the selection here. Note, if you have Retained Revenue Impact Reporting enabled, you will see an additional set of metrics present. You can view the individual customers who have Viewed and Accepted a given offer in the Offer Report Drawer. To access this view, simply click on the offer name you would like to see data for. This will pull up a drawer that displays 50 results. You can filter by fields in the drawer to see who has accepted an offer for example or sort by the offer accept date. From this view, you can export the data set for further analysis or to join to your subscription data to track repurchase cohorts by Offer Type. To change the display name of an offer, go to the Experience Manager and select the Offer Library tab. From here you can edit offer content including changing the offer name. This offer name change will carry through to the Offer Performance Report!",
      "Reporting on Deflection and Save Trends": "We have added two new trends reports to Chargebee Retention to help you get additional visibility into how your Deflection Funnel is performing. The Save Performance Trends report provides visibility into your overall Deflection Funnel performance. We present the total number of cancels, saves and watch list for the given period as well as the Save and Deflect rates for that period. You can hide or remove metrics on the chart by selecting the labels below the graph and can toggle on / off showing data labels in the view. With this new report, you have the ability to track how changes in your Cancel Experience over time are impacting your key rates/session outcomes. The Deflections Trends report gives you a breakdown of the different types of deflection we see in Chargebee Retention. Here you see the total number of loss aversion offer accepts, modal offer accepts and passive deflects for a given period. These are the core types of deflection we see in Chargebee Retention, and it is helpful to be able to track the change in these rates over time as you evolve your testing. Just like with the Save Performance chart, you can toggle on/off the metrics you want to show by selecting the labels below. Now you can track how changes to your offer mix or loss aversion cards are driving those key rates in your cancel experience. If you have any questions on how to track your performance in Chargebee Retention, please contact retention-support@chargebee.com ."
