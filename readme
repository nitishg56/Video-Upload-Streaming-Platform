Pulse – Module Extraction AI Agent

An AI-powered documentation analysis tool that automatically extracts product modules and submodules from help/documentation websites and returns them in a structured JSON format.

This project is built as part of the Pulse – Module Extraction AI Agent assignment.

📌 Problem Statement

Modern software products have extensive help documentation spread across multiple pages.
The goal of this project is to:

Crawl documentation websites

Identify key product modules

Group related submodules

Generate accurate descriptions

Return the result in a clean, structured JSON format

All extraction is done only from the provided documentation URLs, without hallucination.

▶️ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd pulse-module-extractor

2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv


Activate:

Windows

venv\Scripts\activate


Mac/Linux

source venv/bin/activate

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Run the Application
streamlit run app.py


The app will open at:

http://localhost:8501

🧪 Example Usage

Enter one or more documentation URLs (one per line):

https://wordpress.org/documentation/
https://help.zluri.com/
https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/
https://support.neo.space/hc/en-us


Click Extract Modules to view the structured output.

📤 Output Format
[
  {
    "module": "Support & Forums",
    "Description": "Documentation related to support and forums.",
    "Submodules": {
      "Reporting security vulnerabilities": "Steps to responsibly report vulnerabilities...",
      "What do I put in the title of my post?": "Best practices for writing support requests..."
    }
  }
]

🧠 Approach & Design Decisions
Crawling

Recursive crawling restricted to documentation-related URLs

Prevents homepage/UI noise and infinite crawling

Handles redirects and broken links gracefully

Content Extraction

Removes headers, footers, navigation, scripts

Supports multiple documentation layouts:

WordPress

Chargebee

Zluri

Zendesk (Neo)

Module Inference

Modules inferred using:

Page title keywords

URL path signals

Submodules inferred from:

Page-level titles (h1)

Descriptions built only from extracted content

⚠️ Assumptions

Documentation is publicly accessible

HTML content is available without authentication

No JavaScript rendering is required (no Selenium used)

Structure is inferred from headings and semantic content

🚧 Known Limitations

Some platforms (e.g., WordPress.org) do not expose clean category pages
→ In such cases, content is grouped under General Documentation

JavaScript-heavy portals may limit depth of extraction

Deeply nested documentation may be partially flattened

These limitations are intentional design trade-offs to keep the solution efficient, compliant, and deterministic.

✅ Testing & Validation

The project has been tested on the following documentation sources:

WordPress

https://wordpress.org/documentation/


Zluri

https://help.zluri.com/


Chargebee

https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/


Neo (Zendesk Help Center)

https://support.neo.space/hc/en-us
